# Hi, I'm K.Ramu,

I'm currently learning **Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** by participating in the **Edslash 100 Days Challenge** on **LeetCode**.

## About the Challenge
I'm solving one DSA problem every day for 100 days to build consistency, improve problem-solving skills, and prepare for coding interviews.

## My Progress
- Platform: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- Language: Java
- Status: In Progress (Day 23/100)

## Goals
- Strengthen core DSA concepts
- Master Java for competitive programming
- Build discipline through daily problem-solving

Stay tuned for updates as I continue this journey!
