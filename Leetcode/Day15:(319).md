# Day 14 - LeetCode Challenge

## Problem: Bulb Switcher

### Difficulty
Medium

### Tags

---

### Problem Statement

There are `n` bulbs that are initially off. You perform the following steps:

1. Turn on all the bulbs.
2. Toggle every second bulb.
3. Toggle every third bulb.
4. ...
n. Toggle only the nth bulb.

Return the number of bulbs that remain **on** after `n` rounds.

---

### Examples

**Example 1:**  
Input: `n = 3`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation:  
- Round 1: [on, on, on]  
- Round 2: [on, off, on]  
- Round 3: [on, off, off]  
Only the 1st bulb is on.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `n = 0`  
Output: `0`

**Example 3:**  
Input: `n = 1`  
Output: `1`

---

### Constraints

- `0 <= n <= 10^9`

---

## Insight

A bulb toggles on every divisor of its position number.  
Only bulbs with **odd number of divisors** will be **on** in the end.  
Only **perfect squares** have an odd number of divisors.  
So, the answer is the number of perfect squares ≤ `n`.

---

## Solution

### Approach: Count Perfect Squares

Use a simple loop or `Math.sqrt(n)` to count the number of perfect squares ≤ `n`.

---

### Code (Java):

```java
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int i = 1;

        while (i * i <= n) {
            count++;
            i++;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```
Alternative 

```
class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
}
