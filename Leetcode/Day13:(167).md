### Problem Statement

Given a **1-indexed** array of integers `numbers` that is already sorted in **non-decreasing order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, **added by one as the array is 1-indexed**, such that `numbers[index1] + numbers[index2] == target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

---

### Examples

**Example 1:**  
Input: `numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
Output: `[1,2]`  
Explanation: `2 + 7 = 9`. The indices are 1 and 2.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6`  
Output: `[1,3]`

**Example 3:**  
Input: `numbers = [-1,0], target = -1`  
Output: `[1,2]`

---

### Constraints

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- **Exactly one solution** exists.

---

## Solution

### Approach 1: Two Pointers (Optimal)

- Start two pointers: `start` at the beginning, `end` at the end.
- If sum of elements at these pointers equals target, return their indices.
- If sum is less than target, move `start` forward.
- If sum is greater, move `end` backward.

### Code (Java):

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        int start = 0;
        int end = numbers.length - 1;

        while (start < end) {
            int sum = numbers[start] + numbers[end];
            if (sum == target) {
                ans[0] = start + 1;
                ans[1] = end + 1;
                return ans;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                start++;
            } else {
                end--;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
