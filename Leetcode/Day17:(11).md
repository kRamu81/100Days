## Problem: Container With Most Water

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines such that the two endpoints of the `i-th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Note: You may not slant the container.

### Examples

**Example 1:**  
Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`  
Output: `49`  
Explanation: The max area is between indices 1 and 8 with height = 7 and width = 7, area = 49.

**Example 2:**  
Input: `height = [1,1]`  
Output: `1`  
Explanation: Only two vertical lines, area = 1.

---

### Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

---

## Solution

### Approach: Two-Pointer Technique

- Start with two pointers at the beginning and end of the array.
- Calculate the area formed between the lines at these two pointers.
- Move the pointer with the smaller height inward (towards the other pointer).
- Repeat and update the maximum area found so far.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = height.length - 1;
        int maxCap = 0;

        while (start < end) {
            int h = Math.min(height[start], height[end]);
            int width = end - start;
            int currCap = h * width;
            maxCap = Math.max(currCap, maxCap);

            if (height[start] < height[end]) {
                start++;
            } else {
                end--;
            }
        }

        return maxCap;
    }
}
